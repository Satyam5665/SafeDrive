# Web3 Google Drive
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that aims to create a Web3-enabled Google Drive-like platform. It allows users to store and manage files in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. The project is implemented using Solidity for smart contract development, Hardhat as the development environment, React.js for the frontend, Axios for HTTP requests, pinata for file storage, and ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

# Features <br> 
User authentication: Users can create an account and securely log in to the application. <br> 
File uploading: Users can upload files to the decentralized storage system. <br> 
File management: Users can view, download their uploaded files. <br> 
Sharing files: Users can share files with other users by providing them with a unique access link. <br> 
File encryption: Files are encrypted before being uploaded to ensure data security. <br> 
Transaction history: Users can view their transaction history for file uploads and updates. <br> 
# Technologies Used
Solidity: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
Hardhat: A development environment for Ethereum that facilitates smart contract testing, compilation, and deployment.
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
pinata: A file storage service that integrates with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
ethers.js: A library for interacting with Ethereum and Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
